To fix the issue at hand:
1. Implement the fix.
2. Build the app locally to verify there are no compilation errors.
3. If build fails, fix issues and repeat step 2.
4. Before reading log files, delete the old ones.
5. Ask if the version should be bumped or if there are any other requests.
6. If yes, bump the version, commit and push.
